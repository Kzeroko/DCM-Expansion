## Contents and Features

- You can configure this mod in your save file, located in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">*serverconfig/dcmexpansion-server.toml*
- Medical related contents such as First-Aid kit, Adrenaline, Infection Serum etc.
- Immersive Aircraft upgrades, well, pretty overpowered BTW.
- Mod integration items, currently it only has a water bottle for thirst mods.

## Future plans?

- Many mod-integration items(for custom crafting recipes) pretty much most of them for general pack-integration.
- Mr.Crayfish's Gun mod or TAC addon, not much on my thought for the time period.
- Plasma Weapons for Better Combat mod
